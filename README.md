My final project for AP Computer Science, written in Java.

## How to Play

An executable .jar file is included in the repository. Make sure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed, then clone the repository and run iodine.jar.

```
java -jar iodine.jar
```

**iodine** is a fast-paced, two/three player, one-hit KO platform fighter. Even without combos or fancy moves, the game's tight controls and dynamic mechanics give a few simple controls a wealth of depth. Most importantly, iodine is fun and makes for a great excuse for me to play a fun video game in class.

Game controls can be found in the **options** menu.
